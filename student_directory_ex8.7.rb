#Exercise 8.7:
#In the input_students method the cohort value is hard-coded.
#How can you ask for both the name and the cohort?
#What if one of the values is empty? Can you supply a default value?
#The input will be given to you as a string? How will you convert it to a symbol?
#What if the user makes a typo?
